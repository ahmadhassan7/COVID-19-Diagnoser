The novel coronavirus disease (a.k.a COVID-19) pandemic started last year in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. However, it has rapidly spread to the rest of the world, with other countries such as Italy, Iran and Spain among the most affected.

Researchers around the world are collaborating to analyse the behaviour of the virus and implement novel ideas to overcome this crisis. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia and my specialty is in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer vision (CV). As one of those researchers willing to do something about it, I felt duty bound to use my skills and collaborate with other researchers to create solutions that benefit all of us.

A week ago, I first saw on the news that COVID-19 test components are in [short supply and they cannot be manufactured fast enough ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/11/coronavirus-covid-19-response-hurt-by-shortage-testing-components/5013586002/), which is already causing some anxiety in the community. Around the same time, I saw another post explaining how China was using [AI-based systems to speed up the diagnosis process of COVID-19 using only tomographies](https://www.bioworld.com/articles/433530-china-uses-ai-in-medical-imaging-to-speed-up-covid-19-diagnosis) and x-rays. However, this technology and the completed datasets used have not been made publicly available yet. I strongly believe that one of my duties as a PhD researcher is to democratise the use of AI, in particular, when it is related to medical applications. For that reason, I have decided to contribute by creating my own version of an AI-based system that can detect COVID-19 cases vs normal cases from CT scans and x-rays.  At the moment, it has been very challenging to find enough data to replicate such systems. Chinaâ€™s national guidelines have recommended CT scans as a key method in diagnosing COVID-19, however, so far [I have found more publicly available data using x-rays](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset/blob/master/README.md?fbclid=IwAR30yTGBr55WXdCngCoICDENHycmdL2bGwlvl1ckdZM-ucjGH10Uakz7khk). But this might change in the future thanks to the international community and inspiring researchers such as Andre Esteva, PhD, who just a week ago started collecting COVID-19 x-rays and making those data publicly available for the scientific community.

# COVID-19 Detector using Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence might sound like a buzzword to you or something very complicated out of a science fiction book. However, AI has become a mature technology with a huge potential to solve many real-life problems. This is achieved by using Neural Networks, which are created by putting together artificial neurons together. (Yes, Neural Networks are biological-inspired  models of the brain). This is the same kind of technology that is used in [self-driving cars such as Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/en_AU/autopilotAI) or to [detect breast cancer even better than doctors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-02/google-shows-ai-can-spot-breast-cancer-better-than-doctors).

I have created a Neural Network model that is able to predict with 97.5% accuracy from an x-ray whether someone has the COVID-19 virus or not. For my model, I have got a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94.95%. This might sounds very impressive ! However, the dataset used is very small, but we have radiologists right now working with us to validate the model and curate the datasets. So at the moment, this model is far from being useable at scale in any hospital. Actually, I am aware that in some countries, hospitals are not allowed to use or take decisions based on products that have not passed rigid testing standards. For that reason, I have to make a big disclaimer before continuing:
