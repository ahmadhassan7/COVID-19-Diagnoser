# COVID-19 Detector using Artificial Intelligence
This model is able to predict with 98% accuracy from an x-ray whether someone has the COVID-19 virus or not. For my model, I have got a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94.95%. However, the dataset used is very small.

Obtaining 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity implying that:

Patients that do have COVID-19 (i.e., true positives), we could accurately identify them as “COVID-19 positive” 100% of the time using this model. Patients that do not have COVID-19 (i.e., true negatives), we could accurately identify them as “COVID-19 negative” only 80% of the time using this model.

There's still not enough data to train a perfect 100% accurate COVID-19 detector yet there's a large number of patients in hospitals and their data can lead to a nearly perfect, accurate detector.
